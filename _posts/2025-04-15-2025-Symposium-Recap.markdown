## Abstract

The 2025 SKEG Symposium Report provides an overview of the three-day virtual symposium and the evolving structure of the SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG). The group has adopted a Task Force (TF) model to address pressing issues in krill research and to better support CCAMLR's scientific and management needs. This report summarizes the symposium's key discussions, research highlights, and outcomes, with a focus on enhancing collaboration, supporting early-career researchers, and aligning with CCAMLR priorities.

## General Overview

Held from 10–12 March 2025, the annual SKEG Symposium convened approximately 90 participants from 15 countries. The event was hosted online, with sessions scheduled to accommodate global time zones. The symposium emphasized SKEG's restructuring into Task Forces, recent advances in krill and Southern Ocean research, and community engagement—particularly among early-career researchers.

A total of about 90 participants from 15 countries registered for the workshop and contributed to the discussions, including scientists as well as representatives from industry, policy, and NGOs. Live participation was consistent across the three days, and the session recordings were viewed after the event. This extended reach reflects strong overall engagement and helped accommodate participants across time zones and schedules.

One of the key goals in shaping this event was to create more opportunities for Early Career Researchers (ECRs) to actively participate, share their work, and build meaningful connections. Supporting ECRs isn't just about the future of krill research—it strengthens our field today by integrating fresh perspectives and new ideas.
