## 2025 SKEG Krill Symposium

**Dates:** March 10-12, 2025
**Format:** Virtual (6:00 AM CET, up to 3 hours per day)
**Participants:** ~90 participants from 15 countries

This year, we renamed our annual meeting from the "SKEG Workshop" to the "SKEG Symposium" to highlight krill and Southern Ocean research, encourage collaboration, and make time for discussions.

The symposium featured contributions in three formats:
- **2-minute "speed-dating" introductions:** A quick overview of yourself and your work (great for those starting out or new to SKEG)
- **5- or 10-minute research presentations:** Sharing research findings
- **5- or 10-minute idea pitches:** Presenting new ideas or concepts for feedback in a supportive space for brainstorming and refining concepts

In addition to highlighting current research, the symposium included an overview of SKEG's new structure, introducing task forces that members can join, contribute to, or propose.

This symposium was a great chance for researchers at all career stages to connect and share their work, with a specific focus on supporting Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and providing opportunities to network with the broader community.
