## Why Krill?

Antarctic krill play a vital role in the Antarctic food web, providing a major part of the diet of larger species such as whales, seals, penguins and fish. They are also commercially fished in the Southern Ocean and used in the production of fish food, animal feed and human dietary supplements. But even after almost 100 years of research into krill, our understanding of their life history, seasonal spatial dynamics, and response to climate change remains limited. These knowledge gaps make it difficult to predict how krill populations will shift under climate change—a critical question for both conservation and fisheries management.

## About SKEG

The SCAR Krill Expert Group is a volunteer-driven network that provides the forum for researchers, industry, and policymakers to connect and build towards improving our understanding of krill biology and ecology.

## Our Aims

- **Increase Knowledge** – Improve our understanding of krill biology and ecology.
- **Improve Collaboration** – Promote collaboration within the krill community, with emphasis on early-career researchers.
- **Connect the Community** – Serve as the primary conduit between the krill research community and CCAMLR, the body responsible for managing the Antarctic krill fishery.
- **Facilitate Research** – Guide research directions and encourage information exchange on cruises, funding opportunities, and laboratory facilities.

## Who is SKEG

SKEG is an expert group within SCAR (the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research), which coordinates international scientific research in the Antarctic region and provides advice to the Antarctic Treaty and other policy bodies. SKEG members come from universities, national laboratories, NGOs, the fishing industry, and the CCAMLR Secretariat, united by a shared commitment to advancing krill science through collaboration.

## How We Work

SKEG convenes annual meetings, workshops and/or symposiums to share research and build community. Between meetings, Task Forces (small working groups co-led by pairs of scientists) tackle specific challenges, from updating shared databases to coordinating field deployments. This structure keeps collaboration moving year-round and creates entry points for researchers at any career stage to contribute.

## Current Work

In 2025, SKEG restructured around a Task Force model to address specific challenges between annual symposiums. Active Task Forces are:

- **Krill Flux TF** – Establishing a circumpolar mooring network to monitor krill transport and connectivity, with deployments planned aboard RV Polarstern in 2027.
- **Fisheries Indices TF** – Refining stock assessment parameters (growth, recruitment, maturity) and preparing working papers for CCAMLR's Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management.
- **KrillBASE TF** – Updating the KRILLBASE database with post-2014 data and improving coverage in underrepresented regions.
- **Communication & Outreach TF** – Enhancing public and stakeholder engagement through science communication.
- **Krill Carbon Sequestration TF** *(in development)* – Coordinating research on krill's role in carbon export and its recognition within CCAMLR's policy framework.

SKEG is also advancing cross-taxa collaboration, particularly integrating whale science into krill management through partnerships with the IWC and emerging programs like the Humpback Whale Sentinel Program.
