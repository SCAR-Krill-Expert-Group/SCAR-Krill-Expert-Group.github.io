Antarctic krill play a vital role in the Antarctic food web, providing a major part of the diet of larger species such as whales, seals, penguins and fish. They are also commercially fished in the Southern Ocean and used in the production of fish food, animal feed and human dietary supplements.  But even after almost 100 years of research into krill, our understanding of their life history, seasonal spatial dynamics, and response to climate change, is largely unknown. These data gaps limit our ability to predict krill population shifts, according to projected climate change scenarios for the Southern Ocean, an important aspect for krill fisheries management. 

SKEG provides a forum to guide research directions, promote collaboration, improve understanding of krill biology and ecology, and thus assist in providing critical scientific information relevant to krill fishery management. Furthermore, since ship time for krill fieldwork is becoming more scarce, the group provides a forum for information exchange on upcoming cruises and funding opportunities, as well as laboratory facilities for experimental krill work, and serves as a platform for the development of future international collaborative research proposals and programmes.

The SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG) seeks to:

* improve our understanding of krill biology and ecology;
* serve as the primary conduit between the wider krill scientific community and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which manages and monitors the Antarctic krill fishery;
* provide a forum to guide research directions, encourage information exchange and dialogue between krill researchers, fisheries and society;
* promote collaboration within the krill community with emphasis on early-career researchers.

SKEG members come from a wide range of institutions, including the CCAMLR Secretariat, universities, national laboratories, NGO’s, and industry. SKEG interacts with, and provides essential input to existing SCAR groups, such as Integrating Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics in the Southern Ocean (ICED).

Aims and future activities
SCAR Krill Expert Group (SKEG) will:

1) Assist and inform CCAMLR of the latest scientific knowledge on krill biology and ecology to improve management decisions for the krill fishery.
2) Identify fundamental gaps and possible new research directions for krill research.
3) Function as a conduit for the wider krill community outside CCAMLR to access opportunities for research and collaboration, including that with the commercial krill fishing operators.
4) Interact with, and provide input to, existing SCAR groups, to improve our understanding of Southern Ocean ecosystems and the impacts of climate change thereon.
