In 2025, SKEG restructured around a Task Force model to address specific challenges between annual symposiums. Each Task Force is co-led by pairs of scientists and creates entry points for researchers at any career stage to contribute.

## Active Task Forces

## Emerging Initiatives

SKEG is also exploring the development of a **Krill Carbon Sequestration TF** to coordinate research on krill's role in carbon export and its recognition within CCAMLR's policy framework.

Additionally, SKEG is advancing cross-taxa collaboration, particularly integrating whale science into krill management through partnerships with the IWC and emerging programs like the Humpback Whale Sentinel Program.
